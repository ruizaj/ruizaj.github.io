Ever since 2014, the Destiny series was one of my favorite video game franchises of all time. It was created to be a First Person Shooter with elements of typical MMORPG'S like World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy XIV. Because of my passion with the game, I wanted to find other people who share the same drive and love for the game. I went through many different groups, but currently I have stuck with a guild called "Hidden Legion" which uses discord as a means to communicate and update each other whenever something comes up.

As I was one of the more active members, I ultimately became one of the leaders for the PS4 division of the group. This meant that I would schedule raid times, manage which people will be in which groups for the raids, be flexible with others, and just maintain overall order. Discord became a blessing for the group as it became a catalyst for organization and as one of the people who manages the discord, it really taught me good leadership skills, and communication. I also gained a good grasp of time management, as everyone has their schedules to withhold so I had to juggle raid schedules in order for that to happen.
