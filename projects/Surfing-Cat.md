Surfing Cat was my one of my projects for ICS 111. This was a game where you can control a surfing cat with WASD controls with the objective of living as long as possible. You have two number gauges for food and water that slowly decrease as the game goes on. In order to keep those up, you need to collect the Oreos (For the food gauge) and Milk Tea Boba (For the water gauge). There are three hurricanes that are spawned at random areas and constantly move left and right of the screen. Touching them causes both gauges to decrease faster, and once one of the gauges hit 0, it's game over.

This project demonstrated the knowledge I gained of programming - such as for/while loops, conditionals, functions, etc. - from this semester. It used java as the interface for programming while using the JavaEZ library for easier implementations for adding images. This project also allowed for good problem solving skills, which is a tool integral to software engineering and helped with time management skills as we only had two weeks to create the game.
