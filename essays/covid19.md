## Life's A Rollercoaster

To put it simply, 2020 certainly didn't start as intended. Because of personal situations, I was quite on a mental low for the beginning of the year and it was quite tough to pick myself up. In addition to this, the academic semester proved to be the most difficult one, with 17 credits of time consuming classes that take a huge chunk off of my day. But as time went on, it has gotten better with a very productive schedule, mixing in gym with work while being able to maintain school very well. I also started making new friends that made classes and the late night homework sessions bearable. Life was starting to go up and I felt like my low moments were a figment of the past, thinking "I won't let 2020 get the worst of me." That however changed quite quickly once the pandemic began, and life was going down again quite significantly. My once very productive schedule that I loved immensely slipped between my fingers and now finding a way to cope to this realization of our pandemic situation was something that I had to learn. 

There is quite a difference between wanting to stay inside and being forced to because of COVID-19. I'm usually a little introverted so I'm okay with spending time alone huddled in my room with videogames and homework, but I also like the option to go out with my friends and socialize. This situation basically removed any physical social opportunities and that was a tough pill to swallow, because I physically live the furthest away from all my friends. Although currently handling myself quite well, I can't help but feel like I'm set back to square one, as if I never made any progress this year.

## Academic Obligations Don't Feel So Obligated

The ideas of online classes felt great and terrifying at the exact same time. Most of my classes do not fit as an online class because they require face-to-face to make the learning experience work. This heavily applies to ICS 311, which I basically need to meet up with people to work on the homework and just understand the material. The online classes do have their benefits. I don't have to physically walk to classes. Most material and classwork has been either changed or completely disregarded because it is impossible to do them so most of the lesson plans have been heavily simplified. And because everyone isn't used to this new way of learning, most of my teachers put heavy leniency to classes. 

I was honestly looking forward to having Zoom classes, but alas nearly none of my classes use it, but instead force me to learn the material on my own. I thought this wasn't going to be much of a problem, but as time went on it was apparent that it would be mentally difficult to do so. My previous schedule was busy because all my classes had mandatory attendance, but that isn't the case anymore. I really don't feel like I'm in the middle of a school semester currently and that just really takes a huge hit on my willpower to even do work. If I had Zoom classes, perhaps I would feel more obligated to do homework and feel productive, but that is no more. To me, it really feels like we are in a 5 month summer break, and that's just scary to think about.

## Mixing Up My Way of Life

I'm sure many people are dealing with this right now, but these online classes has drastically changed my sleep schedule for the worst. I usually sleep at 12am and wake up around 8, but slowly this has changed to something more like 3am to 11-12. Once I wake up, I try to get something to eat and a few daily routines, but the pandemic has made me feel exceptionally lazy to even start the day. I find myself on my phone for much longer than usual, biding my time before I even try to check emails on potential homework. There's no Zoom classes for me to worry about, so I kind of do my own thing until around 2pm, which is when I start worrying about school work and whatnot. It's really bad that things have come to this, but I can't help that school feels less important during this time.

Because I don't have a gym to go to anymore or work to keep me busy, I basically had to find new things to latch onto to let the time pass. Motivation to workout is quite difficult, but it is a most if I don't want to end up unhealthy and overweight by the time quarantine finishes. To be honest, my favorite thing to do daily is just to go outside and run around my neighborhood. I live in the countryside of Waianae, so there are very nice hike trails that I can choose from and since most people are home anyways, I don't have to worry about social distancing. Because I can't go out to the cityside, doesn't mean I can't enjoy the outdoors and just relish in nature. Finding hobbies was tough initially as well, but I actually got back into making music and just enjoying TV shows that I didn't have to chance to watch due to my busy schedule. 

## There Will Always Be A Brighter Side

I know that this quarantine messed up the mentality of everyone around the world. I definitely felt the lows of what this pandemic has brought upon us, but that doesn't mean that we should let it take control of what we can or can't do. There is a lot of things that one can do indoors, all you need is a bit of motivation to do so. Go workout! Find new music genres to get into. Maybe catch up with some old friends that you haven't talked to in months. You shouldn't let a pandemic keep you down, because as I always see it, things will get better. And like what one of my favorite artists always says, "Here comes better days" - Rich Brian. Be safe everyone and I hope that you can make the most out of this pandemic period.
