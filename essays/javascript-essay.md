## Never Judge A Code By Its Syntax
I have heard many things about JavaScript through my lifetime as being very polarized. I had people tell me that it is one of the most annoying languages and should be replaced by something better, while others praised it for being the most flexible language. Naturally, I was quite scared to see what was all the hoopla was about. When we were given our first assignment in ICS 314 to go through 132 exercises, I thought that I would have to relearn a coding language from the ground up, but that isn't quite the case. The overall structure of JavaScript has a lot of similarities with other languages like C++ and Java, so it was quite easy to understand the basics. It still followed the same logic operations like while and for loops, as well as using the same rules for local scope vs global scope depending on where you initiate variables.

What makes JavaScript quite different from other coding languages is the amount of freedom that you can have. The main thing that popped at me instantly once learning was how all data types were under one thing: var. This one change meant so much! This meant that arrays can hold any datatype, functions can return any datatypes, and much much more. This is quite liberating in comparison to Java, but this could also be a bad thing as it is hard to juggle which variables hold with datatype at a point in time. But with the inclusion of the "ES6" module, var is replaced with let and const variables, which definitely helped out with understanding the scope of each variable.  Another thing that I quite like about JavaScript is how it is an intepreted language, meaning we didn't need compilers like every other language that I learned thus far, meaning that I can just type out code on a browser and it can be run on the spot. 

## The P90X of Coding: WODs 
Another crucial part of our ICS 314 class is our WODs, or "Workouts of the Day"
