Recently, I have been taking a linguistics class and although there are almost 6000 different languages in the world, they all have some form of standard that they must follow. Every language follows their own rules, i.e. English follows a subject, verb, object sentence structure (SVO) while other languages like Korean or Japanese follows a subject, object, verb sentence structure (SOV). Although they are different, these languages must follow those standards or else people wonâ€™t understand each other. This same idea also applies for coding standards as well. You can make a very long and intelligent strip of code that you and the computer understands, but without proper coding standards, it will just look like a jumbled strip of mess that no one else could understand. Coding languages are like written languages. With English, you must finish sentences with a period, and with coding like Java, you have to finish coding thoughts with semicolons, or brackets. Without these standards, are we truly using a language correctly?
