## My Experiences With Radgrad

I started the ICS program in Fall 2018 and on my second semester of classes, I was introduced to RadGrad in one of my ICS 211 classes. Being introduced to the entire system and logging into it the first time was a pleasant experience as it was surprising how much information and formalities were sprawled on the site. The whole level up system was an interesting concept which would incentivize the more competitive people, and it seemed to have many opportunities that you take on. But, since I was only just on my first year of college, I brushed the whole experience aside and tried to worry about academics. Looking back, I know that was a pretty idiotic mindset as now I'm semester away from graduating and only taking a more in depth look at the RadGrad system now. However the changes that I say a couple years ago compared to now is definitely a step up from it's previous conception. There's a lot to work on before a solid launch, but there's definitely some good, some bad, and some really buggy portions that make up this system.

## Personal To Do List
One of the newer functions of the RadGrad system is the Personal To Do List, and for a new user of RadGrad, I think this is an extremely helpful tool. Starting off at the high priority, the website implores you to fix up your degree planner with courses and opportunities, which honestly is a great first step for students unsure of their future classes to take. It also has you add interests as a higher priority which helps with formulating classes tailored to your interests. It's also great that RadGrad takes data from STAR to know if you finished specific classes and makes tasks around this database too. Last high priority, which I think is one of the more important tasks is choosing career goals, which is great that the website pushes towards because the end goal for all of us ICS students is working at a job that we are interested in. The medium priority has tasks that are pretty on point on being more optional to do like making reviews and checking up on your ICE levels, which I'll elaborate on my opinions later. The low priority is something that I expected to be completely optional tasks, but it seems to encapsulate all your finished tasks, which can be misleading to some.

## Interests, Careers, Courses, and Opportunities
As all of these tabs use a similar system of item selection into your profile, I thought it be good to review them as a whole. Each item card for these four sections are quite similar, but they have a really nice design. Since it is connected to a relative profile collections, you can tell which items are on your profile through the green tab, which is a very helpful addition. What I like most of the four is that they are connected by its related data for each item, which really intertwins the whole system like a giant tree. For example, if I wanted to become a Robotics Engineer, the related courses and intersts creates a distinct path to get towards that goal. Functionality wise, I think this is a very strong suit for the system. UI wise, there could be a few improvements to the design, namely the placement of the tags and the frequency of the item listings per row. Another item of note is the opportunities tab, which is honestly a really great portion that allows for very specific internships and events that feel much more specialized than the normal job listings you can see on sites like Indeed or LinkedIn. This also having related data to each listing helps out a lot. Overall these four tabs define RadGrad's functionality as a whole and it sets it apart as a very unique tool for ICS students.

## ICE and Its Levels
The ICE system was the unique system in RadGrad that appealed to me initially as a student in the program because it quantifies the progress into our major in a way that shows how well a person is doing. I think this system is a really good push to students because in order to level up, not only do you need to take classes, but it enforces extra curriculum in order to fill out the I's and E's of the 3 disciplines. This however is where the system could come off as a very steep slope since the idea of the ICE system is that a student can level up once every semester and hit level 6 by their graduation, but reaching that can be quite difficult. For me, I'm level 3, pending level 4 however the jump to level 5 looks daunting to say the least. Also the requirements for each level isn't well specified in the "about the levels" which could be elaborated on in future iterations. 

### To Do List Concerns/Changes
- The high priority implores to add courses and opportunities into the degree planner, but as of this time it doesn't work so that can't be done yet.
- The reviews task doesn't let you opt out of opportunities that you don't have much to say about (for me personally would be the career fair).
- I think that the medium priority should be changed to low priority, and the low priority to be a completed tab to reduce confusion for newer users.

## Recommendations/Notable Bugs
- The semester tags on the Opportunities tab being on the top of the title doesn't look like a good place to put them. Perhaps we can make another section under related skills tab

- Using the website anything other than fullscreen can cause some unnecessary overlapping on some pages like Opportunities.

- The interest tab has items that don't have any related career goals, courses, or opportunities attached to them (like .NET or Azure). If it can't be helped to add them, then this can be negligible.
- In the interest tab, "Theory of computation" should have the C capitalized.
- The levels tab should show not only the level requirements of your next level, but the other levels as well.
- Not all of the ICS classes are implemented into the site yet (notably ICS 427 and 438).
- Courses Tab: Most of the 600+ level classes don't have interests on their cards.
