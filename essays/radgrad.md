## My Experiences With Radgrad

I started the ICS program in Fall 2018 and on my second semester of classes, I was introduced to RadGrad in one of my ICS 211 classes. Being introduced to the entire system and logging into it the first time was a pleasant experience as it was surprising how much information and formalities were sprawled on the site. The whole level up system was an interesting concept which would incentivize the more competitive people, and it seemed to have many opportunities that you take on. But, since I was only just on my first year of college, I brushed the whole experience aside and tried to worry about academics. Looking back, I know that was a pretty idiotic mindset as now I'm semester away from graduating and only taking a more in depth look at the RadGrad system now. However the changes that I say a couple years ago compared to now is definitely a step up from it's previous conception. There's a lot to work on before a solid launch, but there's definitely some good, some bad, and some really buggy portions that make up this system.

## Personal To Do List

One of the newer functions of the RadGrad system is the Personal To Do List, and for a new user of RadGrad, I think this is an extremely helpful tool. Starting off at the high priority, the website implores you to fix up your degree planner with courses and opportunities, which honestly is a great first step for students unsure of their future classes to take. It also has you add interests as a higher priority which helps with formulating classes tailored to your interests, however since the ICS department doesn't have too many 400+ level classes for everything, you are bound to dip your foot into every specialty at least once. It's also great that RadGrad takes data from STAR to know if you finished specific classes and makes tasks around this database too. Last high priority, which I think is one of the more important tasks is choosing career goals, which is great that the website pushes towards because the end goal for all of us ICS students is working at a job that we are interested in. The medium priority has tasks that are pretty on point on being more optional to do like making reviews and checking up on your ICE levels, which I'll elaborate on my opinions later. The low priority is something that I expected to be completely optional tasks, but it seems to encapsulate all your finished tasks, which can be misleading to some.

### To Do List Concerns/Changes
- The high priority implores to add courses and opportunities into the degree planner, but as of this time it doesn't work so that can't be done yet.
- The reviews task doesn't let you opt out of opportunities that you don't have much to say about (for me personally would be the career fair).
- I think that the medium priority should be changed to low priority, and the low priority to be a completed tab to reduce confusion for newer users.

## Recommendations
- The semester tags on the Opportunities tab being on the top of the title doesn't look like a good place to put them. Perhaps we can make another section under related skills tab
